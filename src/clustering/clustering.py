class ClusterBasedDriftDetector:
    """
    Cluster-based data drift detector using X-Means clustering.

    Clustering is performed independently within each class label
    (per class). The resulting clusters are then remapped and merged
    into a global cluster labeling space to allow cross-class
    comparison and unified drift assessment.

    Drift is detected based on four complementary criteria:

    1. Changes in the number of clusters within a class.
    2. Changes in descriptive statistics computed for each cluster.
    3. Shifts of cluster centroids between the old and new datasets.
    4. Changes in average distance of samples to their cluster centroids.

    Clusters from the new dataset are matched to clusters from the old dataset
    using the Hungarian algorithm applied to pairwise centroid distances.

        Minimal difference in shift between clusters to acknowledge the drift.
    thr_centroid_disappear : float, default = 0.5
        Measure how much the cluster must be shifted (in case of euclidean distance) so
        it does not appear that the cluster was shifted, but instead that the old cluster
        disappeared and a new one appeared.

        to acknowledge the drift.
